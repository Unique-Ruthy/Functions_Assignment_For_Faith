Javascript are methods are functions associated with objects, providing functionality to manipulate data or perform actions. common methods are;
STRING METHODS
charAt(index): returns the character at the specified index.
concat(str2):combines two or more strings, toUpperCase(), toLowerCase
ARRAY METHODS includes push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), splice(index, count, element1, ..., element)
OBJECT METHODS includes object.keys(obj), object.values(obj), object.entries(obj)
FUNCTION METHODS includes call, apply ect
ARRAY ITERATION METHODS includes foreach(callback), map(callback), filter(callback)
There are many more methods in javascript for different purposes.

Javascript functions is a block of codes designed to perform a particular task. A Javascript function is executed when "something" invokes it(calls it).A Javascript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by a parentheses(), functions names contains letters, digits , underscores and dollar signs same rules as variables.
The parentheses may includes parameter names seperated by commas. The codes to be executed is closed in a curly bracket{}.
FUNCTION INVOCATION happens when something invokes or calls the function.
When javascript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
NOTE, with function one can actually reuse a code

Functions is composed of a sequence of statements called the function body, values can be passed to a function as parameters, and the function would return a value. In JAVASCRIPT functions are first class objects. What distinguishes functions from objects is that the can be called.If a function's execution doesn't end at a return statement, or if the return keyword doesn't have an expression after it, the the return value is undefined
ARGUEMENTS are passed by a value and never by a reference.
Defining functions in javascript includes generator function, async function, async generator function and regular functions.

Control flow are a foundamental part of any programming language including Javascript, they allow to control the order in which statements are executed in a program based on certain condition or criteria.In Javascript, there are three main types of control flow statements
if/else statements
switch statements
loops
if/else statements are used when we want to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true, and different block of code if the the condition is false. if/else statements executes a block of code if a specified condition is true, if the the condition is false, another block of code would be exe.
Switch statements are used to execute a block of code based on the value of a variable
loops are used to execute codes multiple times based on certain conditions. the two types of loops are for loops and while loops.

Functions are the main building blocks in a program, they allow codes to be called many times without repetition.
To create a new function , we use function declaration. A variable declared inside a function is only visible inside that function.
A function can access an outer variable as well. variables declared outside of any function is known as global variables.
Generally, we can say that functions are actions
